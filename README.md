HackerRank Python Exercises

This repository contains a collection of Python exercises inspired by HackerRank challenges. 
All exercises are implemented in a clean, Pythonic style, with functions, type hints, input validation, and interactive menu-driven execution.

Features

Modular design: Each exercise has a pure function for computation and a runner function for input/output.
Input validation: Prevents crashes when users enter invalid data.
Pythonic code: Uses f-strings, list comprehensions, and clean loops.
Interactive menu: Choose which exercise to run via a simple switch-style menu.
